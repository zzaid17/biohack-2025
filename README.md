This repository is a submission for BioHacks 2025, a two-day hackathon for at the University of Calgary. We developed a data-driven tool that consists of a classification model and user-friendly interface to predict and diagnose various health disorders.

We used one dataset for each major condition - cancer, diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, and stroke. Our initial data analysis consisted of data cleaning, normalization, and calculating the correlation values for each dataset.
